# Tiny_Picture_Frame
 * This uses a Adafruit 1.14" 240x135 tft and a Adafruit itsy bitsy m4 express. It is a portable picture viewer. 
 * You have to resize your pictures to 240x135 for landscape pics and 135x240 for portrait. if you resize under 
 * locked constraints so the picture isnt distorted the height wont always match up and thats ok. I plan to fix 
 * in a centering function next so more of the picture is viewable. You also have to name the pics a number, in 
 * order, so the iteration works. So 0.bmp, 1.bmp, 2.bmp and so on. And they must be .bmp files.
